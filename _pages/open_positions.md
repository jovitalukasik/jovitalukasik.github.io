## Join Our Computer Vision Group: PhD Opportunities Available

We invite motivated students to explore the exciting intersection of visual computing and automated machine learning within the broader context of machine learning. Our research focuses on developing more efficient machine learning approaches for various computer vision tasks. While prior experience with automated machine learning is advantageous, it is not required.

**Eligibility Criteria:**
---
- Candidates must hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or a related field.
- Advanced English skills is required; knowledge of German is not necessary.
- Experience with any programming languages, preferably Python or the willingness to learn Python, is essential.

All PhD positions are full-time employee positions at the University of Siegen, compensated in accordance with public service pay grade [TV-L E 13](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/west?id=tv-l-2023&matrix=1). Contracts are initially fixed-term for three years, with the possibility of extension up to six years. While participation in the teaching responsibilities of our group is expected, most of your time will be dedicated to research.



**Application Process:**

If you are interested, please send your application to jovita.lukasik at uni-siegen.de. We will be interviewing as applications come in. Your application should include the following:

* a cover letter outlining your reasons for applying
* a deeper dive into what research problems are interesting to you and how they related to “Visual Computing”
* a CV
* the (provisional) transcript of record from your studies.

Feel free to add any extra materials that showcase your skills or experiences—like a link to a project you’re proud of on GitHub or contact details for reference person you worked with before.

Please note that applications not clearly addressed to me and the group may be discarded (only including my name does not count).
