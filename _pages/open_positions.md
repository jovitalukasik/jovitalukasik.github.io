## Join Our Computer Vision Group: PhD Opportunities Available

We invite motivated students to explore the exciting intersection of visual computing and automated machine learning within the broader context of machine learning. Our research focuses on developing more efficient machine learning approaches for various computer vision tasks.

**Possible Research Topics (not limited to, but including):**
- model efficiency
- automated neural architecture design
- performance prediction
- robustness of computer vision models
- object reidentification in computer vision
- joint hardware-software optimization (see [Learning2Sense research unit](https://www.learning2sense.de))



**Eligibility Criteria:**
- candidates must hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, or a related field at the time the position starts.
- advanced English skills is required; knowledge of German is not necessary.
- experience with any programming languages, preferably Python or the willingness to learn Python, is essential.

All PhD positions are full-time employee positions (100%) at the University of Siegen, compensated in accordance with public service pay grade [TV-L E 13](https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/west?id=tv-l-2023&matrix=1). While participation in our group’s teaching responsibilities is expected, most of your time will be spent on research.
