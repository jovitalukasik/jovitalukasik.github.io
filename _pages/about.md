I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Computer Vision group](https://www.vsa.informatik.uni-siegen.de) supervised by [Prof. Dr. Michael Moeller](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmoellermath/) at the University of Siegen since April 2023. Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate supervised by [Prof Dr.-Ing. Margret Keuper](https://www.vc.informatik.uni-siegen.de/en/keuper-margret) in the [Computer Vision and Machine Learning](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning) group at the Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics and in the focus group of [Computer Vision in the Data and Web Science Group](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/researchers/phd-students/jovita-lukasik/) at the University of Mannheim. 


Together with [Aaron Klein](https://aaronkl.github.io/), [Arber Zela](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/profile/zela/), [Giovanni Zappella](https://giovannizappella.github.io/) and [Rhea Sukthanker](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/profile/sukthanker/) I also organize the [AutoML Seminars](
https://automl-seminars.github.io/) as part of the ELLIS units Berlin and Freiburg. I was part of the organization team of the second workshop on neural architecture search @ ICLR 2021.

My research mainly focuses on efficient, unsupervised graph representations and embeddings for supervised surrogate models for neural architecture search.
